## Complete Step-by-Step Guide ($10-15/day Budget)

---

## 📊 BUDGET ANALYSIS: Is $10-15/day Realistic?

### **Short Answer: YES, but with realistic expectations**

**What $10-15/day gets you:**
- **Monthly Budget**: $300-450/month
- **Estimated Clicks/Day**: 5-15 clicks (depending on keyword competition)
- **Average CPC**: $2-5 for plumbing-related keywords
- **Expected Results**: 1-3 leads per week (with 2-4% conversion rate)

**Reality Check:**
- ✅ **Yes, you can get results** - This budget is sufficient for testing and small-scale campaigns
- ⚠️ **It's a learning budget** - First 2-4 weeks will be about optimization, not maximum conversions
- ⚠️ **Competition is HIGH** - Plumbing keywords are competitive, but your landing page is well-optimized
- ✅ **Quality over quantity** - Better to get 1 qualified lead than 10 tire-kickers

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2**: Learning phase, Google gathering data ($0-2 leads)
- **Week 3-4**: Optimization phase, refining keywords ($1-3 leads)
- **Week 5+**: Optimized performance ($2-5 leads/week)

**ROI Potential:**
- If you convert 1 lead per week at $5,000 average project value
- Monthly cost: $300-450
- Monthly revenue potential: $20,000+ (if 1 lead converts)
- **ROI: 4,000%+ if successful**
