# Google Ads Strategy for Plumber Leads Landing Page
## Complete Step-by-Step Guide ($10-15/day Budget)

---

## 📊 BUDGET ANALYSIS: Is $10-15/day Realistic?

### **Short Answer: YES, but with realistic expectations**

**What $10-15/day gets you:**
- **Monthly Budget**: $300-450/month
- **Estimated Clicks/Day**: 5-15 clicks (depending on keyword competition)
- **Average CPC**: $2-5 for plumbing-related keywords
- **Expected Results**: 1-3 leads per week (with 2-4% conversion rate)

**Reality Check:**
- ✅ **Yes, you can get results** - This budget is sufficient for testing and small-scale campaigns
- ⚠️ **It's a learning budget** - First 2-4 weeks will be about optimization, not maximum conversions
- ⚠️ **Competition is HIGH** - Plumbing keywords are competitive, but your landing page is well-optimized
- ✅ **Quality over quantity** - Better to get 1 qualified lead than 10 tire-kickers

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2**: Learning phase, Google gathering data ($0-2 leads)
- **Week 3-4**: Optimization phase, refining keywords ($1-3 leads)
- **Week 5+**: Optimized performance ($2-5 leads/week)

**ROI Potential:**
- If you convert 1 lead per week at $5,000 average project value
- Monthly cost: $300-450
- Monthly revenue potential: $20,000+ (if 1 lead converts)
- **ROI: 4,000%+ if successful**

3. Campaign Goal: **"Leads"** or **"Website traffic"**
4. Campaign Name: `Plumber Leads - Website Services`

- **Budget**: $10-15/day
- **Location**: United States (or specific states/cities)
- **Language**: English
- **Ad Schedule**: All days, all hours (optimize later based on data)

### **Step 3: Create Ad Groups (START WITH 2 - Recommended)**

**Why Start with 2?**
- Easier to manage and optimize
- Faster learning phase (Google gathers data quicker)
- Lower risk while testing
- You can add more ad groups after 2-3 weeks once you see what works

**Recommended Starting Ad Groups:**

#### **Ad Group 1: Problem-Aware Keywords** ⭐ START HERE
- **Name**: `Plumber Website Problems`
- **Why This First**: Highest intent - plumbers actively looking for solutions
- **Keywords** (Mix of high-volume + specific):
  
  **High-Volume Keywords (Add These First):**
  - `[plumber marketing]` (Exact Match)
  - `[plumber lead generation]` (Exact Match)
  - `[plumber SEO]` (Exact Match)
  - `"plumber marketing"` (Phrase Match)
  - `"plumber lead generation"` (Phrase Match)
  - `"plumber website marketing"` (Phrase Match)
  - `+plumber +marketing` (Broad Match Modified)
  - `+plumber +lead +generation` (Broad Match Modified)
  
  **Specific Problem Keywords (Keep These - May Show "Low Volume" Initially):**
  - `[plumber website not getting leads]` (Exact Match)
  - `[plumber website not getting calls]` (Exact Match)
  - `"plumber website problems"` (Phrase Match)
  - `"plumber website not generating leads"` (Phrase Match)
  - `+plumber +website +not +getting +leads` (Broad Match Modified)
  
  **Note**: "Low search volume" keywords are fine to keep - they'll become eligible when search volume increases, and they're highly targeted.
  
- **Headlines**: Use Ad Group 1 headlines from section above (10 headlines)
- **Descriptions**: Use Description 1 (Problem-Solution) and Description 3 (Urgency-Focused)

#### **Ad Group 2: Solution-Seeking Keywords** ⭐ START HERE
- **Name**: `Plumber Website Design`
- **Why This Second**: High volume, people ready to buy
- **Keywords** (10-12 keywords):
  - `[plumber website design]` (Exact Match)
  - `[website for plumbers]` (Exact Match)
  - `"plumber website builder"` (Phrase Match)

#### **Ad Group 3: Tool Integration Keywords** (Add Week 3-4)
- **Name**: `ServiceTitan Jobber Integration`
- **Keywords**:
  - `[ServiceTitan website integration]` (Exact Match)
  - `[Jobber website integration]` (Exact Match)
  - `"plumber website with ServiceTitan"` (Phrase Match)
  - `+ServiceTitan +website +plumber` (Broad Match Modified)
- **Headlines**: Use Ad Group 3 headlines from section above (8 headlines)

  - `"increase plumbing business calls"` (Phrase Match)
  - `"plumber website that gets calls"` (Phrase Match)
  - `+plumber +website +leads` (Broad Match Modified)
- **Headlines**: Use Ad Group 4 headlines from section above (10 headlines)
- **Descriptions**: Use Description 3 (Urgency-Focused)

### **Step 4: Keyword Match Types Explained**
- **Exact Match [keyword]**: Only shows for exact search
- **Phrase Match "keyword"**: Shows when phrase is included
- **Broad Match Modified +keyword**: Shows for variations with + words

**Start Strategy**: 70% Exact/Phrase, 30% Broad Modified (to discover new terms)

### **Step 4.5: Handling "Low Search Volume" Keywords**

**What "Low Search Volume" Means:**
- Google won't show ads for these keywords because there aren't enough monthly searches
- This is common with very specific, long-tail keywords
- **Don't delete them!** They'll become eligible when search volume increases

**What To Do:**
1. **Keep the specific keywords** - They're highly targeted and will convert well when eligible
2. **Add broader keywords** - Add higher-volume terms to get impressions immediately:
   - Instead of just "plumber website not getting leads"
   - Also add: "plumber marketing", "plumber lead generation", "plumber SEO"
3. **Use Broad Match Modified** - This helps discover variations:
   - `+plumber +website +problems` will match many related searches
4. **Check back weekly** - Some "low volume" keywords become eligible as search trends change

**Recommended Fix for Your Current Ad Group:**
Add these higher-volume keywords to get impressions:
- `[plumber marketing]`
- `[plumber lead generation]`
- `[plumber SEO]`
- `"plumber marketing"`
- `"plumber lead generation"`
- `+plumber +marketing`
- `+plumber +lead +generation`

These will get impressions while your specific keywords wait for eligibility.

  ### **Step 5: Landing Page URL & UTM Tracking**

#### **Final URL Setup:**
- **Base URL**: `https://www.oabwebagency.com/plumber-leads`
- **Important**: Use the exact landing page URL (no redirects if possible)

#### **UTM Parameters (Why They Matter):**
UTM parameters help you track which ads/keywords are driving conversions in Google Analytics. This is separate from Google Ads conversion tracking but provides valuable insights.

#### **UTM Parameter Structure:**
```
?utm_source=google
&utm_medium=cpc
&utm_campaign=plumber_leads
&utm_content={ad_group_name}
&utm_term={keyword}
```

#### **For Your Campaign, Use:**

**Ad Group 1 (Plumber Website Problems):**
```
https://www.oabwebagency.com/plumber-leads?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=plumber_leads&utm_content=plumber_website_problems
```

**Ad Group 2 (Plumber Website Design):**
```
https://www.oabwebagency.com/plumber-leads?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=plumber_leads&utm_content=plumber_website_design
```

#### **How to Add UTM Parameters in Google Ads:**
1. When creating ads, in the "Final URL" field, enter your base URL
2. Click "Track URL" or "Use tracking template" (if available)
3. Google Ads can auto-add parameters, OR
4. Manually add the full URL with UTM parameters

#### **Alternative: Use Google Ads Tracking Template (Recommended)**
Instead of adding UTM to each ad, set up a tracking template at the campaign level:

1. Go to Campaign Settings → Additional Settings
2. Find "Tracking template" or "URL options"
3. Add: `{lpurl}?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={campaign}&utm_content={adgroup}`
4. This automatically adds UTM parameters to all ads in the campaign

#### **UTM Parameter Breakdown:**
- **utm_source=google**: Identifies Google as traffic source
- **utm_medium=cpc**: Identifies paid search (cost-per-click)
- **utm_campaign=plumber_leads**: Your campaign name
- **utm_content={ad_group}**: Which ad group (auto-filled by Google Ads)
- **utm_term={keyword}**: Which keyword triggered the ad (optional, auto-filled)

#### **Viewing UTM Data:**
- Check Google Analytics → Acquisition → Campaigns
- See which ad groups/keywords drive the most conversions
- Compare with Google Ads data for cross-validation

---

### **Step 6: Conversion Tracking Setup (CRITICAL)**

**Why This Is Essential:**
- Google Ads can't optimize without conversion data
- You won't know which keywords/ads are profitable
- Can't use automated bidding strategies effectively
- Wastes budget on non-converting keywords

#### **Option 1: Google Ads Conversion Tracking (Recommended for Beginners)**

**Step-by-Step Setup:**

1. **Create Conversion Action:**
   - Go to Google Ads → Tools & Settings → Conversions
   - Click "+" to create new conversion
   - Select "Website" as conversion source
   - Choose "Submit lead form" as conversion category
   - Name it: "Plumber Leads - Form Submission"

2. **Conversion Settings:**
   - **Category**: Lead
   - **Value**: 
     - Choose "Use different values for each conversion"
     - Set default value: $100-500 (estimate based on average project value)
     - Or use "Don't use a value" if unsure
   - **Count**: "One" (each form submission = 1 conversion)
   - **Click-through window**: 30 days (how long to attribute conversions)
   - **View-through window**: 1 day (optional, for display ads)

3. **Install Conversion Tag:**
   - Google will provide a conversion tracking code
   - Two options:
   
   **Option A: Google Tag (Recommended - Easier)**
   - Install Google Tag Manager on your site
   - Add conversion tag through GTM
   - More flexible for future tracking
   
   **Option B: Direct Installation**
   - Copy the conversion tracking code
   - Add to your landing page (in `<head>` section)
   - Or add to form success/thank you page

4. **For Your Plumber Leads Page:**
   - Add conversion tag to the form success page/state
   - Or trigger on form submission success message
   - Test by submitting the form and checking if conversion fires

5. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Submit a test form submission
   - Go to Google Ads → Conversions
   - Should see conversion within 24-48 hours (or use Google Tag Assistant to verify immediately)

#### **Option 2: Enhanced Conversions (Recommended for Better Data)**

**What It Is:**
- Sends hashed customer data (email, phone) to Google
- Improves conversion tracking accuracy
- Better for privacy-compliant tracking
- Helps with iOS 14.5+ tracking limitations

**How to Set Up:**
1. In conversion action settings, enable "Enhanced conversions"
2. Add customer data collection to your form submission
3. Google will hash and send: email, phone number, name
4. Improves match rate and conversion tracking accuracy

#### **Option 3: Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Import (Advanced)**

**If You Already Have GA4:**
1. Set up GA4 event for form submissions
2. Link GA4 to Google Ads
3. Import GA4 conversions into Google Ads
4. Can use both GA4 and Google Ads tracking simultaneously

**For Your Landing Page:**
- You already have GA4 tracking (based on your code)
- Event: `conversion_event_submit_lead_form_1`
- Can import this into Google Ads as conversion

#### **Conversion Value Strategy:**

**How to Set Conversion Value:**
- **Conservative**: $100 (low estimate, safe for optimization)
- **Realistic**: $250-500 (based on average project value)
- **Optimistic**: $500-1000 (if you know your close rate)

**Example Calculation:**
- If 1 in 10 leads converts to $5,000 project
- Average lead value = $5,000 ÷ 10 = $500
- Set conversion value to $500

**Why Value Matters:**
- Google optimizes for highest-value conversions
- Helps with "Maximize Conversion Value" bidding
- Better ROI tracking

#### **Testing Your Conversion Tracking:**

1. **Before Launch:**
   - Submit a test form
   - Check Google Tag Assistant (Chrome extension)
   - Verify conversion tag fires
   - Check Google Ads → Conversions (may take 24-48 hours)

2. **After Launch:**
   - Monitor conversions daily for first week
   - Compare with actual form submissions
   - If mismatch, troubleshoot tracking code
   - Verify UTM parameters are working in GA4

#### **Common Issues & Fixes:**

**Issue**: Conversions not showing up
- **Fix**: Check if tag is installed correctly, verify form submission triggers tag

**Issue**: Duplicate conversions
- **Fix**: Check "Count" setting (should be "One"), verify tag isn't firing twice

**Issue**: Conversions delayed
- **Fix**: Normal - can take 3-24 hours to appear in Google Ads

**Issue**: Wrong conversion value
- **Fix**: Update conversion action settings, or use dynamic value passing

#### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Set up conversion tracking BEFORE launching ads
- ✅ Test with a real form submission
- ✅ Use Enhanced Conversions for better accuracy
- ✅ Set realistic conversion values
- ✅ Monitor daily for first week
- ✅ Link GA4 for additional insights
- ✅ Don't change conversion settings after launch (unless necessary)

#### **For Your Specific Landing Page:**

Based on your code, you already have:
- GA4 event tracking: `conversion_event_submit_lead_form_1`
- Form submission tracking via Formspark

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Set up Google Ads conversion tracking (separate from GA4)
2. Add conversion tag to form success state
3. Enable Enhanced Conversions (send email/phone data)
4. Link GA4 to Google Ads and import conversions
5. Use both for comprehensive tracking

**This gives you:**
- Google Ads native conversion tracking (for optimization)
- GA4 event tracking (for detailed analytics)
- Enhanced Conversions (for better accuracy)
- Complete visibility into what's working
