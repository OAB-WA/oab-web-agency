# Google Ads Setup: Free Website Redesign – 3 Campaigns (Plumbers, HVAC, Electricians)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-03  
*Use this for running Search campaigns that send traffic to the free redesign (case study program) landing pages.*

Step-by-step guide to run three separate Search campaigns, one per vertical, each sending traffic to its dedicated free redesign landing page.

---

## 1. Campaign structure (3 campaigns)

**Total budget: $10/day** across all three campaigns. Suggested split:

| Campaign | Goal | Landing page | Daily budget |
|----------|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Free Redesign - Plumbers (US)** | Leads | `/free-redesign/plumbers` | $4/day |
| **Free Redesign - HVAC (US)**   | Leads | `/free-redesign/hvac`     | $3/day |
| **Free Redesign - Electricians (US)** | Leads | `/free-redesign/electricians` | $3/day |

*You can change the split later (e.g. put more on the vertical that converts best).*

**What to expect at $10/day:** Similar to the free audit offer: B2B/marketing keywords (“free website redesign plumber”, “website redesign for HVAC”) typically have **lower competition than consumer terms**, so CPC in the **$2–$8** range is plausible. Expect **1–4 clicks/day** early on; with a 2–5% form conversion rate, **0.5–2 applications per week** in the first 2–4 weeks. Treat **$10/day as a learning budget**. Scale to **$30–50/day+** once you see which vertical converts.

| Budget tier   | Daily  | Clicks/day (approx) | Applications/week (approx) | Use case              |
|---------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Test / learn  | $10    | 1–4                   | 0.5–2                       | Learning, diagnostics  |
| Light run     | $20–30 | 3–8                   | 1–4                         | Early optimization     |
| Growth        | $40–75+| 8–25+                 | 4–12+                       | Consistent applications |

**Per-campaign settings (same for all three):**
- **Campaign type:** Search
- **Goal:** Leads
- **Locations:** United States
- **Languages:** English
- **Bid strategy:** Maximize conversions (or Target CPA once you have ~30 conversions)
- **Conversion action:** Use the conversion that fires when someone submits the free redesign application form (see Conversion tracking below).

## 2. Landing page URLs (with UTM)

Use these final URLs in your ads so you can see performance by campaign and ad group in GA4.

**Plumbers:**
```
https://oabwebagency.com/free-redesign/plumbers?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=free-redesign-plumbers&utm_content={adgroup}
```

**HVAC:**
```
https://oabwebagency.com/free-redesign/hvac?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=free-redesign-hvac&utm_content={adgroup}
```

**Electricians:**
```
https://oabwebagency.com/free-redesign/electricians?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=free-redesign-electricians&utm_content={adgroup}
```

**General (optional):** If you run a single campaign to the main free redesign page:
```
https://oabwebagency.com/free-redesign?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=free-redesign-general&utm_content={adgroup}
```

*(Replace `{adgroup}` with the actual ad group name if you prefer a fixed value, or leave as dynamic if your setup supports it.)*

---

## 3. Ad groups and keywords (per campaign)

Create **2–3 ad groups per campaign**. Keywords target people looking for a **free or low-cost website redesign** for their service business, not consumer “find a plumber” searches.

---

### Campaign 1: Free Redesign - Plumbers (US)

**Ad Group 1 – Plumber website redesign**
- `plumber website redesign`

- `plumber website that gets leads`

**Ad Group 2 – Plumbers / marketing**

- `website for electricians that convert`
- `electrician marketing website`

**Ad Group 3 – Case study / free offer**
- `free website redesign electrician`
- `website redesign case study electrician`
- `free website for electrical contractor`

**Match types:** Same as above (Exact + Phrase first).

---

## 4. Ad copy (Responsive Search Ads)

Use 3 headlines and 2 descriptions per ad. Create 2 RSAs per ad group. Copy aligns with the free redesign offer: new site for more calls and booked jobs, no upfront cost, application-based.

---

### Plumbers – headline & description ideas

---

## 5. Negative keywords (shared or per campaign)

Use the same approach as the free audit campaigns. Add a **shared negative keyword list** (or copy into each campaign) so you don’t pay for consumer, job, or irrelevant searches.

**Consumer / “find a pro”:**
- near me
- find a plumber
- find plumber
- best plumber
- plumber cost
- plumber price
- hire a plumber
- emergency plumber
- plumber repair
- find HVAC
- HVAC near me
- furnace repair near me
- find electrician
- electrician near me
- hire electrician
- electrician cost

**Job-seeking:**
- jobs
- careers
- hiring
- salary
- apply

**DIY / free stuff / templates:**
- free template
- DIY
- how to do it yourself
- tutorial
- course
- certification

**Other:**
- cheap
- discount
- coupon
- review
- reddit
- youtube

*(Add more as you see irrelevant terms in the Search terms report.)*

---

## 6. Conversion tracking

Your site **already fires a Google Ads conversion** when someone submits the free redesign application form:

- **Conversion ID:** `AW-17872130458`
- **Conversion label:** `JB8nCJS-oOobEJqjjMpC`
- **Event label** (in gtag) includes the vertical: e.g. `Free Redesign - plumbers - Application Submitted`, so you can segment by vertical in GA4 or in the conversion name if you import from GA4.

**In Google Ads:**
1. **Tools & settings → Conversions.**
2. If you haven’t already, create (or verify) a **Website** conversion action that matches the tag firing on form submit (e.g. “Free Redesign – Application”).
3. In each of the three campaigns, set **Goals → Conversions** and select this conversion.
4. Optionally set a **value** per conversion (e.g. $100–$300 per qualified application) and **Count: One** per click.

**Important:** Free Redesign campaigns must **not** use the same conversion goal as Free Audit. If all campaigns share the "Submit lead form" goal (with "Free Audit Plumbers" etc.), the Free Redesign campaign optimizes for the wrong conversion and reporting is mixed. Follow 6.1–6.2 below to separate them.

---

### 6.1 Create the Free Redesign conversion (if it doesn't exist)

1. In Google Ads: **Goals → Conversions**.
2. Click **+ New conversion action** → **Website**.
3. Choose **Manually add conversion actions** (or use "Use Google Tag Manager or gtag.js" and enter the values below).
4. Enter:
   - **Conversion name:** e.g. `Free Redesign - Application` (or "Free Redesign – Plumbers" if you create one per vertical later).
   - **Conversion ID:** `AW-17872130458`
   - **Conversion label:** `JB8nCJS-oOobEJqjjMpC`
5. Settings: **Value** = Use value from tag (site sends $100) or set a fixed value; **Count** = One; **Click-through window** = 90 days (or your preference).
6. Save. The new conversion will appear under **Goals → Conversions**.

If this conversion already exists (e.g. under "Custom goals"), note its name and go to 6.2.

---

### 6.2 Use only the Free Redesign conversion for Free Redesign campaigns

1. Go to **Goals → Conversions** and open the **Summary** (or **Settings**).
2. Find the goal that includes "Free Audit Plumbers" (e.g. "Submit lead form"). Do **not** add the Free Redesign conversion to this goal.
3. Either:
   - **Option A – New goal:** Create a new goal (e.g. "Submit lead form – Redesign") and add **only** the "Free Redesign - Application" conversion. Then assign this goal to the Free Redesign campaigns (step 4).
   - **Option B – Campaign-level:** Assign the conversion directly at campaign level (step 4).
4. **Per campaign:** Open **Campaigns** → select **Free Redesign - Plumbers (US)** (and any other Free Redesign campaigns).
   - Go to the campaign **Settings** (or use the **Goals** column / **Edit**).
   - Under **Conversion goals** (or **Select conversion actions for this campaign**):
     - **Remove** "Free Audit Plumbers" (and any other Free Audit conversions) from this campaign.
     - **Add** only **"Free Redesign - Application"** (or the name you used in 6.1) as the primary conversion for this campaign.
5. Save. Repeat for **Free Redesign - HVAC** and **Free Redesign - Electricians** when you create those campaigns.

**Result:** Free Audit campaigns keep using the Free Audit (GA4) conversion; Free Redesign campaigns use only the Free Redesign conversion. Bidding and reporting will be correct for each offer.

---

### 6.3 Quick reference (site already fires this)

- **Conversion ID:** `AW-17872130458` · **Conversion label:** `JB8nCJS-oOobEJqjjMpC`
- Fires on: successful submit of the free redesign application form (all verticals; vertical is in `event_label`).

In each Free Redesign campaign, set **Goals → Conversions** so the only primary conversion is "Free Redesign - Application". Do not include "Free Audit Plumbers" or other audit conversions in Free Redesign campaigns.

---

**Optional – separate conversion per vertical:**  
If you want each campaign to optimize to its own conversion (e.g. “Free Redesign – Plumbers”, “Free Redesign – HVAC”, “Free Redesign – Electricians”), create three conversion actions in Google Ads, get three `send_to` values, and add them to the site (e.g. in env or a config) so the form fires the correct `send_to` based on the `vertical` prop. Right now one conversion fires for all verticals with the vertical in the event label; that is enough to run and optimize, and you can add per-vertical conversion actions later if needed.

---

## 7. Ad extensions (all three campaigns)

**Sitelinks (suggested):**
- **How it works** → `https://oabwebagency.com/free-redesign/plumbers` (or hvac/electricians) + `#audit-form`
- **Case studies** → `https://oabwebagency.com/case-studies`
- **FAQ** → `https://oabwebagency.com/faq`

**Callouts:**
- No Upfront Cost
- Application-Based
- Built for More Calls & Booked Jobs

**Structured snippets (optional):**
- Type: Services → e.g. Website Redesign, Lead Generation, Conversion Optimization

Use the same extension ideas for HVAC and Electricians; only the “How it works” final URL changes to the correct landing page.

---

## 8. Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] Three campaigns created (Free Redesign - Plumbers, HVAC, Electricians).
- [ ] Locations: United States; Language: English.
- [ ] Budget and bid strategy set per campaign.
- [ ] Ad groups and keywords added (Exact/Phrase).
- [ ] RSAs created per ad group with correct headlines/descriptions.
- [ ] Final URLs use the right landing page + UTM (see section 2).
- [ ] Negative keyword list created and attached to all three campaigns.
- [ ] Conversion (existing Free Redesign application conversion) assigned to all three campaigns.
- [ ] Sitelinks and callouts added to each campaign.

---

## 9. Post-launch (first 2 weeks)

- [ ] Check Search terms report; add irrelevant terms as negatives.
- [ ] Compare cost per conversion across the three campaigns; adjust budgets if one vertical is clearly better or worse.
- [ ] Pause very low CTR or high-cost keywords; add new keywords from search terms that convert.
- [ ] Let RSAs run; then duplicate and test new headline/description variants.

---

## 10. Why 3 campaigns

- **Separate budgets** so you can spend more on the vertical that converts best.
- **Separate bid strategies** so you can use different target CPAs per vertical later.
- **Clear reporting** (spend, applications, cost per application per campaign).
- **Easy scaling/pausing** (e.g. scale Plumbers, pause Electricians) without touching the others.

---

## 11. After you make updates

**What to expect after these updates**
- More impressions and possibly more clicks after adding keywords or broadening match.
- Campaign diagnostics may clear some warnings after 1–2 weeks; “Bid strategy inactive” often stays until you have enough conversions.
- Cost per click and cost per application may shift as volume changes; give it 1–2 weeks before judging.

**When to check for results**
- **First check:** 3–5 days after the change (see if impressions/clicks moved).
- **Meaningful check:** 7–14 days (enough data to compare to before).
- **Ongoing:** Use the post-launch checklist (section 9) weekly.

**What to do next**
- Re-open **Campaign diagnostics** and see if the same issues remain or new ones appear.
- If conversions are coming in: keep Maximize conversions; once you have ~30 conversions, consider switching to Target CPA.
- Update this doc’s **Document history** (and CHANGELOG_GOOGLE_ADS.md) with the change and, if you like, the *Result* after 1–2 weeks.

## Document history

- **2026-02-03** – Section 6: Added 6.1–6.3 for separating Free Redesign conversion from Free Audit. Step-by-step to create/verify the Free Redesign conversion (ID/label), use it only for Free Redesign campaigns, and remove Free Audit conversions from those campaigns. *Why:* Free Redesign campaign was using same goal as Free Audit; bidding and reporting need the correct conversion per offer.
- **2026-01-30** – Initial version: 3 campaigns (Free Redesign - Plumbers, HVAC, Electricians), landing page URLs with UTM, ad groups and keywords (redesign-focused), ad copy ideas, negative keywords, conversion tracking (existing tag + optional per-vertical), extensions, checklists. *Scope:* All free redesign campaigns. *Why:* Provide a playbook for running Google Ads to the free redesign offer; conversion already fires on the site.
