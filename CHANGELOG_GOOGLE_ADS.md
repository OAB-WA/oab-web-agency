### 2026-01-30
- **GOOGLE_ADS_FREE_AUDIT_3_CAMPAIGNS.md** – Plumbers: added 6 keywords (Ad Groups 1 & 2: website/audit, SEO/leads); clarified Exact/Phrase first, broad match later. Added "Last updated", template note, Document history, and **section 11: After you make updates** (What to expect | When to check | What to do next). Enriched 2026-01-30 history entry with those three. *Why:* Campaign diagnostics: "Not targeting relevant searches" / "Targeting fewer searches". *Scope:* Plumbers only.
- **GOOGLE_ADS_STRATEGY_PLUMBER_LEADS.md** – Synced with 3-campaign doc; added "Last updated", template note, Document history, and **After you make updates** section (What to expect | When to check | What to do next). *Scope:* Plumbers only.
- **CHANGELOG_GOOGLE_ADS.md** – Created master changelog for all Google Ads strategy docs. *Why:* Single place to see what changed when; reuse playbook for new projects. *Scope:* All docs.
